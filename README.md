## Getting started

Download the **latest stable release** [here](https://github.com/veeenu/sekiro-practice-tool/releases/latest).

Prerequisites:

- Steam must be open. Offline mode is fine, but the program must be started.
- Antiviruses are disabled. This includes Windows Defender. If you don't want to do that, make sure to whitelist the contents of the practice tool in your antivirus.
- You have a legitimate copy of the game. Pirated copies will never be supported.

## Running the tool

### Standalone

- Extract all files from the zip archive. Anywhere will do.
- Start Sekiro.
- Double-click `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.exe`.

The tool will automatically appear over the game. Press `0` to open and close its interface.

### Installed

- Extract all files from the zip archive.
- Rename `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.dll` to `dinput8.dll`. Make sure your [file extensions are visible](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/)
  to ensure you are naming the file correctly.
- Copy `dinput8.dll` and `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.toml` to you Sekiro game folder.
  The files must be in the same folder as `sekiro.exe`.
- Start Sekiro normally.

The tool is now installed. To load it, start the game, press the right shift button and 
keep it pressed for a few seconds until the tool appears on screen.

If you don't do that, the tool won't load and the game will start normally.

## Running the tool on Linux

The tool fully supports Linux and should run on Steam Deck seamlessly.

### Standalone

If you want to run the tool in a standalone fashion, I recommend [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks):

```sh
protontricks-launch --appid 814380 jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.exe
```

### Installed

Follow the same instructions as above. Additionally, you have to set the launch options in Steam as follows:

```sh
WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8=n,b" %command%
```
