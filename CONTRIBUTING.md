# Development

You will need:

- A recent [Rust nightly](https://rustup.rs/)
- The [MSVC toolchain](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

Most building functions are exposed by the [xtasks](https://github.com/matklad/cargo-xtask).

## Run the tool

```
cargo xtask run
```

This task will compile and run the practice tool from the repo.

## Distribution artifacts

```
cargo xtask dist
```

This task will create release artifacts in `target/dist/jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.zip`.

## Code generation

```
cargo xtask codegen
```

This task is responsible for generating Rust code from various external sources.
Examples: params from [Paramdex](https://github.com/soulsmods/Paramdex), base pointers for
array-of-byte scans from the Sekiro executables.

## Environment

Some tasks require you to have environment variables defined that are dependent on your system.
You can put all your task-specific environment variables in a `.env` file in the top level directory
of the project. Complete example:

```
$ cat .env
SEKIRO_PATCHES_PATH="C:/Videogames/SekiroPatches"
```

# Lints and format

Before opening a pull request, please make sure that the code is formatted properly and has no 
outstanding lints. Use `nightly` for opting into the experimental lints and format rules.

```sh
cargo +nightly clippy
cargo +nightly fmt --all
```
