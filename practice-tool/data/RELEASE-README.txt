Welcome to the Sekiro Practice Tool!

The tool can be run stand-alone, or it can be installed next to the game's executable.

To run the tool stand-alone:

- Extract all the files from the archive in a directory.
- Double-click `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.exe` while the game is running.

To run the tool with installation: 

- Extract all the files from the archive in a directory.
- Rename `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.dll` to `dinput8.dll`. Make sure your file extensions are visible
  to ensure you are naming the file correctly.
- Copy `dinput8.dll` and `jdsd_sekiro_practice_tool.toml` to you Sekiro Game folder. The
  files must be in the same folder as `sekiro.exe`.
- Start Sekiro normally.
- While it is starting, press and hold right shift for a few seconds, until the tool appears.
